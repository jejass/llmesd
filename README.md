# LLME-ESD: Concept Unlearning with LLM-Enhanced Prompts

This project extends the [ESD (Erase and Suppress Diffusion)](https://github.com/rohitgandikota/erasing) framework.  
ESD is a framework for **concept unlearning** in **Stable Diffusion** models.  
The original ESD can erase a *single* specified concept.  
In this extension, we integrate a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to automatically generate multiple related concepts for joint erasure, improving **generalization and robustness** in concept unlearning.
