Before writing the final JSON output, think briefly about 3–5 semantic categories or synonyms related to the target concept (e.g., subtypes, visual contexts, or alternate expressions).  
Then, select the most representative [number] terms that best describe the concept in different semantic angles.  
Do not output your reasoning — only output the final JSON list.
